      <description>If you believe you&amp;rsquo;ve identified a security vulnerability in Mastodon (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible), you should send the report to security@joinmastodon.org. We will gladly reward such reports in proportion to the severity of the issue through our OpenCollective fund.&#xA;You should not report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s users to increased risk.</description>

      <description>Code structure The following overview should not be seen as complete or authoritative but as a rough guidance to help you find your way in the application.&#xA;Ruby app/controllers Code that binds business logic to templates app/helpers Code that can be used from views, i.e. common operations app/lib Code that doesnâ€™t fit in the other categories app/models Representation of data entities and their associated methods app/policies Permission checks and other validations, before calling related methods app/serializers Code that generates JSON from models app/services Complex logical operations involving multiple models app/views Templates for generating HTML or other output app/workers Code that executes outside the request-response cycle spec Automated test suite JavaScript app/javascript/mastodon Code for the frontend React.</description>

      <description>config/routes.rb Explanation of routes Mastodon uses Ruby on Rails, which defines its router configuration at config/routes.rb. You may view the Ruby on Rails routing guide for more detailed information, but this page will explain the basics of how Mastodon handles routing.&#xA;How routes are constructed namespace is a prefix for routes mapped to a certain controller directory. resources are mapped to controllers within that namespace directory. scope passes to the module&amp;rsquo;s controller.</description>

      <description>Quick start with Vagrant For convenience, the Mastodon repository includes a Vagrantfile for quickly setting up a development environment without manual configuration. To use this development environment, install Vagrant using a binary executable or through your package manager.&#xA;Once you have Vagrant installed, for convenience, it is recommended to install a plugin to automatically update your machine&amp;rsquo;s hosts file. This will allow you to access the dev environment at http://mastodon.</description>

      <description>Mastodon is a Ruby on Rails application with a React.js front-end. It follows standard practices of those frameworks, so if you are already familiar with Rails or React.js, you will not find any surprises here.&#xA;The best way of working with Mastodon in a development environment is installing all the dependencies on your system, rather than using Docker or Vagrant. You need Ruby, Node.js, PostgreSQL and Redis, which is a pretty standard set of dependencies for Rails applications.</description>
